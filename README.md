# Intra-Satellite Communication MAC Protocols in OMNeT++

A discrete-event simulation project that evaluates **MAC (Medium Access Control) protocols** for **intra-satellite LiFi (Light Fidelity)** communication using OMNeT++.

## What This Project Does

Inside a satellite, multiple subsystems (e.g. payload, power, attitude control) often share a single optical wireless link. This project simulates that shared optical channel and compares how different MAC protocols perform when several nodes contend for the medium—including under **hidden-node** conditions where nodes cannot sense each other’s transmissions. The goal is to understand which MAC strategy (TDMA, CSMA, or ALOHA) scales best and gives predictable latency for time-critical traffic like telemetry and telecommand (TMTC).

## What The Simulation Models

- **Shared optical channel** — One `OpticalChannel` module that all nodes use. Simultaneous transmissions cause collisions (detected and reported back to senders).
- **Nodes** — Each node has a configurable MAC and generates packets at a fixed rate (e.g. 20 packets/s per node). Traffic load scales with the number of nodes.
- **Topologies** — Same logical “shared medium” is used in three network shapes for configuration and reporting: **Ring**, **Star**, and **Bus**. Ring uses a 2-hop path per packet; Star and Bus use 1 hop, so you can compare how hop count affects delay and contention.
- **MAC protocols** — TDMA (fixed time slots), CSMA (carrier sense, exponential backoff, retries), pure ALOHA (random retransmit), and CSMA with RTS/CTS (optimistic). Each records per-node metrics: generated/delivered packets, collisions, retries exhausted, PDR, and end-to-end delay (mean, max, jitter).

You can vary the number of nodes (4, 8, 12, 16), switch topologies (Ring vs Star vs Bus), and compare protocols under the same offered load to study scalability and the impact of deterministic vs contention-based access.

## Protocols Compared

| Protocol     | Type             | Collision handling   |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **TDMA**     | Deterministic    | Slot-based, no contention |
| **CSMA**     | Contention-based | Exponential backoff, retry limit |
| **ALOHA**    | Contention-based | Random retransmit    |
| **CSMA_RTS** | Contention-based | RTS/CTS (optimistic model) |

## Metrics (Per Node)

- **Generated** — Packets offered to the MAC  
- **TX_Attempts** — Transmission attempts (including retries)  
- **Collisions** — Collision count  
- **Delivered** — Successfully delivered packets  
- **RetriesExhausted** — Packets dropped after max retries (CSMA)  
- **PDR** — Packet delivery ratio (Delivered / Generated)  
- **AvgTxAttemptsPerDelivery** — Channel uses per delivered packet (reflects hop count)  
- **E2EDelayMean** — Mean MAC delay (generation to delivery)  
- **E2EDelayMax** — Worst-case delay  
- **E2EDelayJitter** — Standard deviation of delay  

## Project Output

Each run produces **scalar results** (one set per node, plus network-level if aggregated):

- **Scalar files** — OMNeT++ writes scalars (e.g. `*.sca`) into the results directory configured in the IDE. Each node records: Generated, TX_Attempts, Collisions, Delivered, RetriesExhausted, PDR, AvgTxAttemptsPerDelivery, E2EDelayMean, E2EDelayMax, E2EDelayJitter.
- **What you get per run** — A snapshot of how that MAC performed for the chosen config (node count, topology, run length). By running multiple configs (e.g. Scalability-TDMA-4/8/12/16, Scalability-CSMA-4/8/12/16, Topology-Star-TDMA-8 vs Topology-Ring-TDMA-8), you obtain comparable data to plot PDR vs node count, delay/jitter vs protocol, and topology impact.

No GUI charts are generated by default; you use the scalar data in the OMNeT++ Result Analysis tool or export to CSV/other tools for plotting and reporting.

## What The Project Gives You

- **Protocol comparison** — Side-by-side PDR, delay, and jitter for TDMA, CSMA, and ALOHA under the same offered load and topology, so you can rank protocols for reliability and latency.
- **Scalability** — How each MAC behaves as the number of nodes (4, 8, 12, 16) increases with fixed per-node load. You can identify at which point contention-based protocols start to degrade (e.g. PDR drop, high retries exhausted).
- **Topology impact** — Star (1 hop) vs Ring (2 hops) comparison: more hops mean more channel uses per packet and higher contention, so you can see whether MAC conclusions hold across topologies (see `TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`).
- **Latency and predictability** — E2EDelayMean, E2EDelayMax, and E2EDelayJitter support arguments about time-critical TMTC: which MAC gives bounded delay and low jitter (see `LATENCY_METRICS.md`).
- **Reusable setup** — A clean OMNeT++ model (shared optical channel, pluggable MACs, multiple configs) that you can extend (e.g. more MACs, different traffic, or physical-layer effects).

## Final Conclusion

- **TDMA** provides **deterministic, collision-free** access: PDR stays at 1, delay and jitter are **bounded and predictable**, and performance scales with node count for the same per-node rate. It is the **best choice for time-critical TMTC** in intra-satellite LiFi when deadlines and latency guarantees matter.
- **CSMA** and **ALOHA** are **contention-based**: under hidden-node conditions and as the number of nodes or hops increases, collisions and retries grow, so **PDR drops**, **delay and jitter become large and unpredictable**, and **retries exhausted** increase. They are suitable for best-effort traffic but **not** for strict TMTC requirements without over-provisioning or hybrid schemes.
- **Topology** (Star vs Ring) does not reverse the ranking (TDMA remains best) but **amplifies** the gap: multi-hop (Ring) worsens contention-based performance more than single-hop (Star), reinforcing the case for **deterministic scheduling** in ring-like or multi-hop intra-satellite optical networks.

**In short:** for intra-satellite optical communication with multiple subsystems on a shared channel, **TDMA is the recommended MAC** when the focus is scalability, predictable latency, and reliable delivery; contention-based protocols degrade under load and are less suitable for time-critical TMTC.

## How To Run

1. **Open** the project in the OMNeT++ IDE.  
2. **Build** the project (e.g. Build → Build Project).  
3. **Select config** in the Run dialog (e.g. `Scalability-CSMA-8`, `Topology-Star-TDMA-8`, `Ring4`, `Star8`).  
4. **Run** the simulation; inspect **scalar results** (PDR, E2EDelayMean, E2EDelayMax, E2EDelayJitter, etc.) in the results folder or Analysis tool.

To change the default MAC in `omnetpp.ini`, set e.g. `**.macType = "MacTDMA"` (or `MacCSMA`, `MacALOHA`, `MacCSMA_RTS`).
